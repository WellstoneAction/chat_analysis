What are they learning?
===========================

Maintained by A.R. at Wellstone Action

Movement tech toolkit that makes use of the Python NLTK (natural language processing toolkit) library to look for trends and insights into participant learning in online trainings that use chat logs for instruction.

Qualitative and quantitative tools included. Some quant tools require high number N of chat messages to reach statistical significance.



Analysis options (updated Jun 28, 2017)
----------------------------------------------------

1. Keyphrase search plus context printer (e.g. search for "libertarian" or "mobilizing" and output chat message it occurs in, plus its user and date)
2. Engagement metrics (Pull top commentors, plus who is talking and how often?)
3. Threads (pull out and analyze threads where users are talking to each other)
4. Conceptual development (chronological threads of use of X term by Y user over time)
5. * sentiment analysis. Looking for libraries to help identify stagnation vs action emotions.
